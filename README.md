Command-based code for FRC 5122's 2016 Robot

The robot used an 8-wheel drivetrain and a rotating shooter to score low and high goals in the Stronghold game.
Coding was mainly done over February break (February 15-19), 2016, and was adjusted for our three competitions: WPI, Pine Tree, and Battlecry.
This is my second composition of FRC robot code, and my first time programming a robot for competition.
As seen in the commit history, I started working on an auto recording function to hopefully enable us to score in auto.
Though I didn't get to finish this function for this season, perhaps it will be completed later...
